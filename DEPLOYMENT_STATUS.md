## ⚡ Auto-Deployments Enabled

Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel will automatically:
- Build your project

## 🎯 Current Status:

- [x] Git initialized
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] Vercel CLI installed
- [x] Deployment config added
- [ ] **Vercel deployment** ← You need to do this now

---

## 💡 Important Notes:

1. **No dependencies installed locally** (due to disk space)
   - That's OK! Vercel will install them during deployment
   
2. **Node modules not pushed** (in .gitignore)
   - That's correct! Vercel builds from package.json

3. **Your logo is included** in the repository

4. **All pages are complete** and ready to deploy

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Ensure you're connected to the right GitHub account
3. Verify the repository is public or Vercel has access

---

## ✨ Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (2 minutes)
2. **Get your live URL**
3. **Test all pages**
4. **Add custom domain** (optional)
